# User-levevl thread library

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a user-level thread library for Linux, which will allow for the creation and execution of concurrent threads. Through this library, applications will be able to utilize the benefits of multithreading, such as improved performance and resource management. The implementation will follow existing lightweight thread libraries by providing round-robin scheduling, preemption, and thread synchronization through semaphores.
